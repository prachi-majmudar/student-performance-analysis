# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

This project investigates whether academic success is a result of being "born smart" or influenced by external factors such as study hours, attendance, parental education, and internet access.

Using real-world-inspired student performance data, we perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), visual comparisons across categories, and classification modeling to uncover patterns and insights.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand what factors most impact student academic success.
- Identify how features like study habits, gender, parental education, and internet access relate to student outcomes.
- Use classification models to predict Pass/Fail outcomes.
- Create interactive visualizations to support data storytelling.
